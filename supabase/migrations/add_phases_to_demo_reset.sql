-- Extends the Phase D nightly demo reset (demo_projects_nightly_reset.sql)
-- to cover the new phases table (phases_schema.sql). Without this, phases
-- would be the one piece of demo-project content the nightly reset doesn't
-- snap back - a visitor toggling a demo project's Execution phase to
-- Custom dates would have that change persist forever instead of resetting
-- with everything else. Run this AFTER phases_schema.sql.
--
-- Same shadow-table approach as every other table in
-- demo_projects_nightly_reset.sql: `like phases including defaults`. Note
-- that "including defaults" does NOT carry over generated columns'
-- generation expressions automatically the way it does for normal
-- defaults, but that's fine here - effective_start_date/effective_end_date
-- recompute themselves from the other columns the moment a row lands in
-- either table, generated or not.
--
-- Ordering: phases is a parent of tasks (tasks.phase_id references it), so
-- on delete it goes out AFTER tasks (children before parents, matching the
-- existing milestones/sprints ordering) and on insert it goes back in
-- BEFORE tasks (parents before children) - otherwise a reinserted task
-- pointing at a not-yet-restored phase would fail the FK check.
